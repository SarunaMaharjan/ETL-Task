Strengths:
This was my first time implementing such an approach, and I see it as a strength that 
I was able to successfully complete the task. 
The most challenging part for me was handling date and OID fields, where I spent the majority of my time.

Limitations:
As I am new to this approach, there is still room for lots of improvement.
I look forward to exploring and improving these aspects as I gain more experience.
